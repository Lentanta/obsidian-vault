## IAM & AWS CLI
IAM
Root account 
User
![[Screenshot 2024-08-14 at 10.50.24.png]]
IAM: Permissions
Define the permissions of users
Don't give permission more than user need

IAM Dashboard
IAM is not a global service
Not a best practice to use the root user
UI: Users 
-> create user 
-> I want to create an IAM user 
-> Create a group

## IAM
--- 
- User: mapped to the physical user, has a password for the AWS console
- Groups: contains users only
- Policies: JSON doc that outlines permissions for users or groups
- Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
- Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK
- Audit: Credential report & Access Advisor
## Budget setup
---
Billing and Cost Management section
- Budget: set budgets to get alert to email
## AWS EC2
---
**Instance types**
Ex: m5.2xlarge
- m: instance class
- 5: generation
- 2xlarge: size within the instance class
## Security Groups
---
- Only contain allow rules
- Can reference by IP or by security group
- Can be attached to mulitple instances
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Live outside the EC2
- Good to maitain one separate security group for SSH access
By default:
- All inbound traffic is blocked
- All outbound traffic is authorised
Port:
- 22 = SSH
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocal)
- 22 = SFTP 
- 80 = HTTP
- 443 = HTTPS
- 3389 - RDP (For window)
## SSH EC2
---
- Generate key pair and dowload
- `chmod 400 <file-key>.pem`
- `ssh -i <file-key>.pem ec2-user@<ec2-ipv4>`
## Modify EC2 IAM role
---
Actions -> security -> Modify IAM role

### Instances options
On-demaned Instances:
- Pay for what you use
- Highest cost and no upfont payment
- No long-term commitment
- For **short-term** and **un-interrupted workloads**
Reserved Instances:
- Reserve a spesific instance attributes (Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
- Reservation Period (From 1 - 3 years)
- Payment options: No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront
- Reserved Instance's Scope: **Regional** or **Zonal**
- For steady-state usage applications
Saving Plans Instances:
- Same as Reserved Instances
- Commit to a certain type of usage
- Usage beyond is billed at **On-demaned** price
- Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region
Spot Instances:
- Can lose at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- The cheapest intances
- For workloads that are resilient to failure
Dedicated Hosts:
- A physical server
- Allow address comliance requirement and use server-bound software licenses
- Purchasing options: On-demand, Reserved
- Most expensive option
- For software that have complicated licensing model
Deicated Instances:
- Different from Dedicated Hosts
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement#
![[Screenshot from 2024-08-19 18-08-46.png]]
Capacity Resvervations:
- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ (Avaliable Zone)
- No time commitment
- Charged at On-Demand rate whether you run it or not
- For short-term, un-interrupted workloads that need to be in a specific AZ
## EC2 Spot Instances
---
- Can only cancel EC2SI request that are open, active, or disabled.
- **Cancelling a EC2SI Request does not terminate instances**
### Spot Fleets

## Elastic IP
---
Not recommend using Elastic IP
- EC2 instance -> Asociate Elastic IP address
## Placement Groups
---
EC2 instance placement strategies:
**Cluster**: All E2 instances are in the same AZ
- Pros: 
	- Great network
- Cons: 
	- If the AZ fails, all instances fails at the same time
- Use case: 
	- Big Data job that need to complete fast
	- Application that needs extremely low latency and high network between instance
**Spread**: All EC2 instances will be in different hardware
- Pros:
	- Can span across AZ
	- Reduced risk is simltaneous faiure
	- EC2 Instances are on different physical hardware
- Cons:
	- Limited to 7 intances per AZ per placement group
- Use cases:
	- Application that needs to maximize high availability
	- Critical applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other
**Partition**:
![[Screenshot from 2024-08-21 15-34-16.png]]
- Pros:
	- Up to 7 partitions per AZ
	- Span across mulitiple AZs in the same region
	- Up to 100s of EC2 instances
	- The instances in a partition don't share racks
	- Failure can affect many EC2 but won't affect other partiions
	- Get access to partition information as metadata
- Use cases:
	- Big data services
## Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
---
EC2 -> Network Interface
- Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
- Give a seccond Private IPv4 address
- Attach on the fly
- **Bound to a specific AZ**
- If terminate EC2 then ENI will be deleted
## EC2 Hibernate
---
In creating EC2 Intances:
Advance settings: Top - Hibernate behavior
Storage(volumes): Advance -> **Encrypted** -> KMS key aws/ebs
(Root volume must be Encryted)

Stop: The data on disk (EBS) is kept intact in the next start
Terminate: EBS volumes also set-up to be destroyed is lost
Using EC2 Hibernate:
- RAM state is perserved
- Instance boot much faster
- RAM state is written to a file
- The root EBS volume must be encrypted
## EBS Volume (Elastic Block Store)
---
Think of them as a "network USB stick"
- **Network drive** can attach/dettach to instances while they run
- Allow persist data, even after their termination
- (CCP level) can only be mounted to 1 instances at a time
- (ACP level) Multi-attach
- **Bound to a specific AZ**
#### Delete on Termination attribute
When EC2 instance terminates:
- By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
- By default, any other atteched EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disbled)
Can be controlled by AWS console/CLI
**Use case: perserver root volume when instance is terminated**
#### Snap shots
- EBS snapshot Archive
	- 75% cheaper
	- Take within 24 to 72 hours for  restoring the archive
- **Recycle Bin** for EBS Snapshots
	- Can recover after an accidental deletion
- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
	- Force full initialization of snapshot to have no lentancy of the first use
Note: right click snapshot -> copy snapshot
## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
---
- AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
- AMI are built for a specific region
- Launch EC2 instances from:
	- Public AMI provided by AWS
	- Your own AMI
	- An AWS Marketplace AMI
#### AMI Process
![[Screenshot from 2024-08-22 10-07-12.png]]
Creatng a AMI in EC2 Instances screen -> right click 
## EC2 Instance Store
---
- High-perfromance hardware disk
- Better I/O performance
- Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temorary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
#### Types of EBS Volume
- gp2/gp3 (SSD): General Purpose SSD (**can be used as boot voumes**)
- io1/io2 Block Express: Provisioned IOPS (SSD) (**can be used as boot voumes**)
- st1(HDD)
- sc1(HDD)
EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS (I/O Ops Per Sec)
## EBS Multi-Attach (io 1/io 2 family)
---
![[Screenshot from 2024-08-22 15-57-29.png]]
- Attach the same EBS volume to muliple EC2 instances in the same AZ
- Each instance has full read & write permissions
- **Up to 16 EC2 instaces at a time**
- Must use a file system that's cluster-aware
## EBS Encrytion
---
When create an encrypted EBS:
- All the data, snapshots, volumes created from snapshot will be encrypted
- Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
- EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
#### Encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume
1. Create an EBS snapshot of the volume
2. Encrypt the EBS snapshot (using copy)
3. Create new EBS volume from the snapshot
4. Attach the encrypted volume to the original instance
## EFS (Elastic File System)
---
- Managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted on many EC2
- EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Pay per use
![[Screenshot from 2024-08-22 16-30-34.png]]
- Share different AZ
## EBS vs EFS
---
#### EBS volumes:
- On instance (expect multi-attach io 1/io 2)
- Locked at the AZ level
- gp2: IO increases if the disk size increases
- gp3 & io 1: Can increase IO indenpendently
- To mifreate an EBS across AZ -> Take snapshot -> restore snapshot to another AZ
- EBS backups use IO and should't run them while application handing traffic
- Root EBS Volumes get terminated by default if EC2 instance gets terminateds (Can disable this option)
#### EFS Volumes:
- Mouting 100s of intances across AZ
- EFS share website files
- Only for Linux Instances (POSIX)
- EFS has a higer priec point then EBS
- Can leverage Storage Tiers for cost savings

## Scalability vs High Availability
---
Scalability
- Vertical: increase instance size/tier
- Horizontal: Auto scaling group, load balancer
Availability
- Make sure your service don't die
- Auto scaling group multi AZ, Load balancer multi AZ
## ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)
---
#### Health Checks
- Are crucial for Load Banlancers
#### Types of load balancers
- Classic Load Balancer (CLB) (Removed)
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
#### Application ALB
- Layer 7 (HTTP)
- Routing based on path URL, hostname, query string, headers
- Great for micro service & container-based application
**Can config EC2 Rule to only access with ALB target Group**
#### Network NLB 
- Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
- Has **one static IP per AZ** and support ElasticIP
### Gateway GLB
- Layer 3 (Network Layer)
- Transparent Network Gateway & Load Balancer
- Uses the **GENEVE** protocol on **port 681**
- Target groups: EC2, IP address
![[Pasted image 20240827110520.png]]
## Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
---
- Cookie used for stickiness has an expiration data you control
- NLB works without cookies
- Use case: User does not lose his session data
- May bring imbalance to the BEnd EC2
#### Cookie Names (Type)
- Application-based Cookies
- Duration-based Cookies
## Cross-Zone Load Balancing
---
- Distributes evenly across all registered instances in all AZ
## Server Name Indication (SNI)
---
- An TLS is new SSL (TLS == SSL)
- ALB and NLB support multiple listner with multiple SSL certificates
- Add listener -> Set security policy
## Connection Drainning
---
Naming: 
- In CLB is Connection Draining
- In ALB & NLB is Deregistration Delay
- Stop sending new request to the EC2 which is **de-registering**
- Between 1 to 3600 seconds (default: 300 sec)
## Auto Scaling Group
---
- Scale out/in to match load
- Metrics such as Avg CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances
- Create launch template -> config the desire and min/max 
#### Scaling Policies
- Dynamic Scaling
	- Target Tracking Scaling
	- Simple/ Step Scaling (triggered by CPU, Metrics)
- Scheduled Scaling
#### Good metrics to scale on
- CPUUtilization: Avg CPU
- RequestCountPerTarget
- Average Network In/Out
- Any custom metric
#### Scaling cooldowns
- ASG will not launch or terminate additional instances
- Use a ready-to-use AMI to reduce config time
### Relation Database Service (RDS)
---
#### Storage Auto Scaling
- Increase storage on your RDS BD dynamically
- Automate scaling
- Have to set Maximum Storage Threshold
#### Read Replicas
Scale your database reading.
- Read Replicas within the same region is free
![[Pasted image 20240828144918.png]]
#### RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
![[Pasted image 20240828145211.png]]
#### From single AZ to Multi AZ
- It's a zero downtime operation
#### RDS vs RDS Custom
- RDS: database & OS managed by AWS
- RDS Custom: Full admin access to OS and DB
## Amazon Aurora
---
- Better performance than RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows and faster replicate
- Cost more than RDS
![[Pasted image 20240828161657.png]]
#### Auto scaling
#### Custom Endpoints
- Point read to custom replica
#### Aurora Serverless
- ...
#### Global Aurora
#### Machine Learning
## RDS & Aurora Backups
---
RDS:
- Automated backups
- Manual DB Snapshots
Aurora:
- Automated backups
- Manual DB Snapshots
#### Aurora Database Cloning
- Create a new Aurora DB Cluster from an existing one
- Faster than snapshot & restore
## RDS Proxy
---
- Allows app to pool and share DB connections
- Improving DB effciency by reducing the sress on DB
- Reduced failover time by up 66%
- No code changes required for most apps
- Enforece IAM Authentication for DB
- RDS Proxy is never publicy (must be accessed from VPC)
## ElastiCahe
---
**To managed Redis or Memcached** 
Redis:
- Multi AZ
- Can scale reads
- Using AOF persistence
- Backup and restore
- Support Sets and Sorted Sets
Memcached
- Muilti-node (sharding)
- No replication
- Non persistent
- No backup and restore
- Multi-threaded architecture
#### Cache Security
- Support IAM
- Redis AUTH
#### Patterns for ElastiCache
- Lazy loading: Cache hit and miss
- Write throught
- Session store
Use case: Realtime sorted data
## Ports
---
**Important ports:**
- FTP: 21
- SSH: 22
- SFTP: 22 (same as SSH)
- HTTP: 80
- HTTPS: 443
**vs RDS Databases ports:**
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- MySQL: 3306
- Oracle RDS: 1521
- MSSQL Server: 1433
- MariaDB: 3306 (same as MySQL)
- Aurora: 5432 (if PostgreSQL compatible) or 3306 (if MySQL compatible)
## Route 53
---
![[Pasted image 20240830095925.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240830100253.png]]
#### Record Types
- A: maps a hostname to IPv4
- AAAA: maps to hostname to IPv6
- CNAME: maps a hostname to another hostname
- NS: Name Servers for the Hosted Zone
	- Publix Hosted Zones
	- Private Hosted Zones
#### TTL (Time To Live)
Cache the DNS result
- High TTL (Take time the apply change)
- Low TTL (Quick change but costly)
#### CNAME vs Alias
CNAME
- Points a hostname ton any other hostname
- ***ONLY FOR NOT ROOT DOMAIN***
Alias
- Points a hostname to an AWS resource
- ***WORK FOR NOT ROOT and ROOT DOMAIN***
- Free of charge
#### Routing policies
Simple routing:
- Route53 set many IP to the domain
- Client will chose random IP to connect
