## Schema
---
**A cluster can have many databases.** **A database can have many schemas.** **A schema can have many objects**. By object, the most familiar is a table, but there are other kinds of objects: views, functions, custom types, and sequences.

Reasons to use schemas:
- To allow many users to use one database without interfering with each other.
- Organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable.
```SQL
-- Create a schema 
CREATE SCHEMA schema_name;

-- Create ta able in schema
CREATE TABLE schema_name.table_name (...)
```
