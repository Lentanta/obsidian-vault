## Normal Forms in DBMS
---
**First Normal Form (1NF):**
- **Atomicity:** Each cell in the table contains only a single value. This means no repeating groups or arrays of data within a single cell.
- **Primary Key:** The table has a primary key, which uniquely identifies each row.
- **No Duplicate Rows:** There are no identical rows in the table.
