## What is NodeJS

- Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
- A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
## **Differences between Node.js and the Browser**

- Donâ€™t have DOM and Window APIs
- Support ES2015(ES6)+ and need to transform your code to be ES5-compatible before shipping it to the browser.
- Supports both the CommonJS (require) and ES module (import) systems
